# Virtual Reality Project with React.js, Vite, and A-Frame

This is a virtual reality project developed in React.js using Vite as the development environment and the A-Frame library to create immersive experiences. In this README, I will explain how I set up the project and which files were used.

## Setup

To get started with this project, you need to have Node.js and npm installed. Additionally, we have used Vite as the development environment and A-Frame as the virtual reality library. Make sure Node.js is installed on your system, and then follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or create your own React.js project with Vite.
2. Run the following command to install Vite and A-Frame:

```bash
npm install aframe
```

## Project Files

### 1. YoutubeVideo Component

In the `./components/` folder, I've created a custom component called `YoutubeVideo.jsx`. This component is used to integrate YouTube videos into the virtual reality scene using A-Frame. You can explore the source code of this component to understand how it works.

### 2. MP4 Video

I have uploaded an MP4 video file named `aeropuerto-malaga.mp4`. This file is located in the `./public/` folder. You can use this video in your virtual reality project to create a unique experience.

## Usage

To use the `YoutubeVideo.jsx` component and the MP4 video in your project, make sure to import the component in your `app.js` (or any other relevant component) and reference the MP4 video in your A-Frame scene.

Check `app.js` file

Remember to customize and adjust the configuration to meet the needs of your project.

## Running the Project

To start the project and view the virtual reality experience in your web browser, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
